// This line includes the iostream header, which stands for Input/Output Stream. It is necessary for using the input and output functions in C++.


using namespace std;
// This line brings the entire standard C++ library into the current scope. It allows you to use standard C++ elements, such as cout and endl, without needing to specify the namespace each time.


// This line declares the main function, which is the entry point of every C++ program.
int main(){

    cout<<"hello world"<<endl;
    // Here, you use the cout object to output the string "hello world" to the console, followed by the endl (end line) manipulator, which represents a newline character.

    // The return statement indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns the value 0 to the operating system.
